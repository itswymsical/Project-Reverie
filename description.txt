Reverie is a mod that aims to add as many layers as an onion to Terraria's sandbox formula. By introducing a variety of subworlds, Unique and interactive NPCs, missions and mini-boss hunts, Reverie injects the "Looter Shooter" formula into Terraria's foundation.
You like XP? A Skill Tree? Cool mini-bosses with viable loot? Reverie will provide that and a whole lot more!

Reverie Adds:
A pantheon of mini-bosses and bosses, Large ecosystems known as Otherworlds, Mission System and Experience System, Terraria-esque Soundtrack, and refined gameplay elements that create more variation in combat builds.
